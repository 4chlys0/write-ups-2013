**Category:** Exploiting
**Points:** 400
**Author:** r1cky
**Description:**

> One of our informants met a guy who calls himself Elite Arthur, he is a real jackass, and he thinks he is the best hacker alive. We got reason to believe that the robots hired him to write the firmwares for their weapons. But to write such a firmware we need the key to sign the code. Luckily for us, our informant also found his website: â€¦. your job is to hack the server, find the flag and show this little cocksucker how skilled he really is. We count on you.

> Announcement: Okay you can stop struggling now: XSS is not the way; leave the http cookie alone; get RIP to do the final trick!
