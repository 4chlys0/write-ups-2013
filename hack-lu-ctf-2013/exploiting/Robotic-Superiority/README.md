**Description:**

> Help us fight the evil robotic lieutenant Don Sim. He wants to spread robo propaganda to cover his actions on the Oktoberfest. But he needs good video footage for that. So he created an IRC bot that collects information about robots in movies. Robotic emancipation can NOT happen, you have to stop him! All we need is his private key. Our agents located the bot, here is all we know about it:
> 
> Server: irc://ctf.fluxfingers.net:1313 
> Bot: lib[1-5] (load balancer) 
> Key: /var/private/key.txt 
> 
> Hint: All available commands are listed with "help". 3 connections allowed per ip.
