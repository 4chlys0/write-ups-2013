# Hack.lu CTF 2013: Beer Pump Filtration

**Category:** Misc
**Points:** evaluated
**Author:** FluxFingers
**Description:**

> Our agents observed that the famous robot Bender is part of the robot forces. Somehow he looked pregnant but his big belly is now gone. We fear that they might have smuggled some of Benders freshly brewed BenderBräu into our beer supplies. This is why we need brave women and men to test whether BenderBräu can cause severe damage on the human body or not, to avoid poisoning the whole party. But you have to test quick! Everyone is thirsty!
> 
> For testing you need to drink 0.5 liter of beer, preferably wheat beer, as fast as you can.
> 
> Make a video of your brave tasting and hand it in. The video must contain a proof of the current date. Show to us the totally secure and random Nonce "17" as well as your teamname written on... something. Also show us the closed beer bottle before, the empty after the tasting, and prove that it is 0.5 liters.
