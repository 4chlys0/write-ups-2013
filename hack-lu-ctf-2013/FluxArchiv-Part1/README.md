**Description:**

> These funny humans try to exclude us from the delicious beer of the Oktoberfest! They made up a passcode for everyone who wants to enter the Festzelt. Sadly, our human informant friend could not learn the passcode for us. But he heard a conversation between two drunken humans, that they were using the same passcode for this intercepted archive file. They claimed that the format is is absolutely secure and solves any kind of security issue. It's written by this funny hacker group named FluxFingers. Real jerks if you ask me. Anyway, it seems that the capability of drunken humans to remember things is limited. So they just used a 6 character passcode with only numbers and upper-case letters. So crack this passcode and get our ticket to their delicious german beer!
