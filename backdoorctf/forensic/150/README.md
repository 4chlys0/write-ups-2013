**Description:** 

> H4x0r decided he needs one more extra layer of advanced security. His access key is a QR code, and keeps the only copy in his wallet. But when leaving his castle he fell into the moat and the QR code got wet and disfigured. Now he cant get back into his own castle and desperately needs a real hacker's help. His post on craigslist says so. This is your chance to get into his head. 
> 
> Here is the disfigured QR code:-
> 
> The Flag is md5 of last 13 characters of password hidden in the QR.
> 
> H4x0r promises to reward 150 h4x0rcoins anyone who gives him the password.
> 
> 
> HINT: Hmmm... Can't I just try and reverse the fading somehow?
