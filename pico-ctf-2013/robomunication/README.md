## Write-up

This challenge involves transcribing and decoding Morse code. 

Listening to the supplied mp3 we can hear the robots speaking in "beep"s and "boop"s. Transcribing those beeps and boops and decoding them using a [Morse code chart](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/International_Morse_Code.svg) gives us our answer. 

**Answer: BOOPBEEP**
